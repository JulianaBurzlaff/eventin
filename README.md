# 🎫 Functionalities

1. <strong>Admin control </strong>: panel for registration and management of events, users and attendants. Only the admin will have access to the registration data. 

2. <strong>User access </strong>: the user has access to all event data (date, time, description), previously registered by the admin. During the session, the user can subscribe (unsubscribe), generating a ticket with a unique QR Code for each registered event.

3. <strong>Attendant validation </strong>: the attendant is the only special user that can validate a QR Code in event entrance. Each ticket can only be used once.
